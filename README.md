Dijikstra's Algorithm

The graph.txt file is read from the project's folder, so the same location as the src folder.
The classes used to run the program, goes inside the src folder with netbeans.
If there is no src folder, then place it where all the java codes run in the same file, due to the variables being protected.
you can modify the graph.txt file to generate different examples.
